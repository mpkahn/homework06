## Weather Forecast App

## Description
Weather forecast app is a simple web app that displays the current and upcoming weather for any given city that is entered.

## Installation
Clone this repository and open html (js inline) and css files in code editor. View website at https://mpkahn.github.io/homework06/. Images in assets folder.

## Usage
Open https://mpkahn.github.io/homework06/ And you will see a mostly blank page with a text field asking you to input a city. 

Type your city and click on the blue search bar.

You will then see the current day's weather information on the right hand side (including date, condition (with image), temperature, humidity, and wind speed)

The upcoming 5 day's forecast down below the bottom of the page, this includes only date, condition (with image), temp, and humidity.
Lastly, a list of recent searches underneath the search bar is displayed (unfortunately these are not clickable)
